This blog was built using a lot of different examples which I've tried to detail below.  This is all in windows using:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Jupyter
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/)

All of the files for this blog can be found on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/stembl).

## Goals
I had the following goals in mind while trying to piece together this blog.

* Static blog using GitHub Pages
* Clean and modern looking interface
* Easy to write, edit, and upload posts
* Ability to include Jupyter notebooks easily
* Search-able post tags
