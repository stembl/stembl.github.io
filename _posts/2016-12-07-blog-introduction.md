## Introduction

I have always been interested in topics around the intersection of Nature and Design. I started really looking at the topic when the term biomimicry was introduced to describe technology inspired by biology.  At the time, the prototypical examples were Velcro and a exterior paint with self cleaning properties similar to a lotus flower. Since then, amazing Designs have been found in Nature and we've been struggling to capitalize on them. I believe this is due to a variety of factors and one I would like to explore is the different design constraints between Human and Natural solutions.

## Questions

This blog attempt to address the following questions.

* What are the Design constraints of Natural and Human systems?
* How does Scale affect Natural and Human Design?
* Can a method be developed to translate a Natural into a Human Design?

## Methods

To address these questions, I plan on employing a few different methods.

* Writing code to illustrate interesting concepts.
* Reading and posting notes to related books.
* Writing blog posts to refine my understanding of the questions.
