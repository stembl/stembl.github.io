## Introduction

I have always been interested in topics around the intersection of Biology and Design. I started really looking at the topic when the term biomimicry was introduced to describe technology inspired by Biology.  At the time, the prototypical examples were velcro and a new exterior paint with self cleaning properties similar to a lotus flower. Since then, amazing Designs have been found in Biology and we've been struggling to capitalize on them.

## Questions

This blog attempt to address the following questions.

* What are the Design constraints of Biological and Human systems?
* How does Scale affect Biological and Human Design?
* Can a method be developed to translate a Biological into a Human Design?

## Methods

To address these questions, I plan on employing a few different methods.

* Writing code to illustrate interesting concepts.
* Reading and posting notes to related books.
* Writing blog posts to refine my understanding of the questions.
