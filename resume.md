## WORK EXPERIENCE

[Dell](https://www.dell.com/en-us)

`Systems Development Engineer`, 06/2012 - Present

Development of complex system models including direct liquid cooling solutions at the datacenter scale to identify optimal hardware development goals and 2-phase thermal solutions to explore next generation concepts.
Design and development of reliability sensors for use in next generation servers.
Design and development of novel thermal solutions to improve percent heat capture in next generation HPC systems.
Mechanical lead on Dell designed RF shielded rack allowing our customers to deploy thousands of devices for app development. Developed with  a smaller footprint and improved performance compared with existing products.
Designed and implemented a packaging system that with an improved response and 40% cost reduction.
Designed and implemented a modular ramp which is deployed on every ESI and GIS rack delivery. This design requires one person to assemble as opposed to the 4 required with the previous design.
Drove suppliers building a custom rack to improve tolerance loop and manufacturing processes. Reduced deployment failures from 70% to 0.  
Composed custom applications to efficiently analyze weeks worth of shock and vibration data reducing analysis time 92%.
Implemented impact and vibration data collection system to capture real world transportation environmental conditions improving validation, packaging, and server design.
